Interface Description Languages (IDLs) are used to define and describe the structure and behavior of APIs. They provide a standardized way to define the inputs, outputs, and operations of an API, as well as any constraints or requirements that must be met.

IDLs can be used to generate code for client and server applications, as well as documentation and other artifacts. They can also be used to validate API requests and responses, and to ensure that APIs are consistent and well-designed.

Some popular IDLs include OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, RAML, Smithy, and GraphQL. These languages are typically protocol and language agnostic, meaning that they can be used with a wide range of communication protocols and programming languages.

# Selection Criterias

List of selection criterias for choosing an IDL
- Protocol agnostic
- Language agnostic
- Platform agnostic
- Tooling support: the availability and quality of tools and libraries for working with the IDL, such as code generators, validators, and documentation generators.
- Community support: the size and activity of the community around the IDL, including forums, documentation, and examples.
- Flexibility: the ability of the IDL to support a wide range of use cases and scenarios, and to be easily extensible and customizable.
- Standardization: the degree to which the IDL is standardized and widely adopted, which can help to ensure interoperability and reduce vendor lock-in.
- Maturity: the maturity of the IDL, including the number of years it has been in use, the number of users, and the number of releases.
- Performance: the performance of the IDL, including the speed of code generation and the size of the generated code.
