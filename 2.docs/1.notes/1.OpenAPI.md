## OpenAPI Specification

The [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#4---companiesprojects-using-openapi-generator) is a specification for describing and documenting RESTful APIs. It is a language-agnostic, human-readable format that can be used to describe the structure and behavior of an API, including its endpoints, operations, parameters, responses, and data models.

### Endpoints

```yaml
# Define the available paths and operations for the API
paths:
  /sensor_data:
```

### Operations

```yaml
 # Define the GET operation for the /sensor_data path
    get:
      summary: Get all sensor data
      responses:
        '200':
          description: OK
        '404':
          description: Not Found
```

### Parameters

```yaml
    # Define the GET operation for the /sensor_data path
    get:
      summary: Get all sensor data
      parameters:
        - name: limit
          in: query
          description: The maximum number of sensor data entries to return
          required: false
          schema:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            maximum: 100
        - name: start_time
          in: query
          description: The start time for the sensor data entries to return
          required: false
          schema:
            type: string
            format: date-time
        - name: end_time
          in: query
          description: The end time for the sensor data entries to return
          required: false
          schema:
            type: string
            format: date-time
      responses:
        '200':
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/SensorData'

```

### Schemas

```yaml
# Define the SensorData model schema
    SensorData:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        timestamp:
          type: string
          format: date-time
        value:
          type: number

# Define the POST operation for the /sensor_data path
    post:
      summary: Create a new sensor data entry
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/SensorData'

```


### Documentation

```yaml
# Define the OpenAPI version
openapi: 3.0.0

# Define general information about the API
info:
  title: Sensor Data Analysis App API
  version: 1.0.0
```


## OpenAPI Generator

The OpenAPI Generator can generate a variety of components on a system level, including:

- Client SDKs for a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, Ruby, and TypeScript.
- Server stubs for a variety of server-side frameworks, including Spring Boot, Flask, and Ruby on Rails.
- API documentation in a variety of formats, including HTML, Markdown, and PDF.
- Integration with various tooling and IDEs, including Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.
- Custom code generators that can be used to generate code for specific use cases or frameworks.

Overall, the OpenAPI Generator is a powerful tool that can help developers quickly generate code and documentation for their APIs, and it can be customized to fit a wide range of use cases and requirements. 

In the context of this project, we will be using the OpenAPI Generator to generate the client SDKs for the API. This will allow us to quickly and easily generate code for the client-side of the API, which can then be used to build the client application.
